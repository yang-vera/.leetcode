# Testcase Example:  '[2,3,1,1,4]'
#
# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the
# first index of the array.
# 
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that
# position.
# 
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
# ‚Å†   Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
# 
# Note:
# 
# You can assume that you can always reach the last index.
